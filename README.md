# Detection of Solidification Defects During Continuous Casting in Steelmaking  
## Modeling for the Company [EBDS ENGINEERING](http://www.ebds-engineering.com/home)


### Project Overview  
This project involves the development of a detection system for identifying solidification defects (commonly referred to as "sticking events") during the continuous casting process in steelmaking. Using a combination of linear regression models and temperature sensors, the system predicts and visualizes potential sticking events in real-time, improving monitoring and operational efficiency.

### Context  
Continuous casting is a crucial process in steelmaking, where molten steel solidifies as it flows through a cooled mold. However, defects like sticking or fractures near the meniscus can disrupt the process, leading to operational inefficiencies and safety hazards.  
This project models these defects by analyzing thermal data and applying statistical methods to detect and predict such phenomena.
