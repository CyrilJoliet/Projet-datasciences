### Context: Continuous Casting Defect Detection
Continuous casting is a key process in steel production, where molten steel is poured into a cooled mold to solidify into semi-finished products. One significant challenge in this process is the occurrence of "sticking," where solidified steel adheres to the mold, leading to cracks and defects. This phenomenon can cause costly production stoppages, equipment damage, and product quality degradation. To mitigate this, advanced monitoring systems using fiber optics have been adopted by EBDS Engineering to detect subtle temperature variations in the mold that often precede sticking events. In this project, we introduce our approach of using linear regression to detect these phenomena and prevent the formation of defects during the production process.


### Usage  
To set up the environment for this project, the following packages must be installed:  
* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* scikit-learn
* seaborn

they can be installed using the following cmd command:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn seaborn
```
