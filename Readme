1) Check Conditions:
Inside the loop, when the conditions are met, calculate a score for each condition.

2)Assign Scores:
Each condition gets a normalized value between 0 and 1, such as:

Slope proximity (|15| to 0) → 1 for valid slopes.
R² values → score based on closeness to 1.
Counter / 5 → score based on how far the counter is towards the threshold.
3) Weighted Sum:
Combine the scores using a weighted sum to compute the final score.

Right now, equal weights are used for all conditions (e.g., 1/7).
